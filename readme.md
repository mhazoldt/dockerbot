# Dockerbot

## About
No, not that docker üê≥. Dockerbot is a Twitch chatbot that allows a streamer to dock other streams onto theirs as a video overlay. It can also be used as an overlay to easily add streams without the chatbot. I created this to bring some of that functionality to Twitch. I also wanted to learn Electron. This was thrown together as a side project, a lot of critiques could be made but I think it is useable and a reasonably good example on tying together Electron and React.

Per using Electron it runs on Windows, MacOS and Linux.

## Technologies

* Node - JavaScript runtime
* Electron - Crossplatform desktop UI
* React - Dynamic and performant HTML/CSS rendering
* Babel - Transpile React JSX and allow for modern JavaScript features.
* Webpack - Used with Babel loader to transpile and bundle dependencies for Electron render process, Electron main process and React JSX.
* Electron Packager - Used to package everything into an executable that can run on a desktop.
* Gulp - Task runner to automate restarting the application on file changes during development and the build command to run Electron Packager.
* TMI - Library for creating Twitch IRC chatbots.

## Commands

* !dock - docks a chat users stream
* !undock - undocks a chat users stream
* !docked - returns a list of the users currently docked
* !dockhost - the chatbot joins the rooms of the users who are docked, this command returns the URL of stream using the Dockerbot overlay
